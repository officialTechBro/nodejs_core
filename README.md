# Node.js Core Modules Practice

Welcome to the **Node.js Core Modules** repository! This project serves as a practical hands-on demonstration of Node.js built-in modules. It is intended for beginners, students, and developers who want to understand how to work with the most commonly used core modules in Node.js without external dependencies.

## 🧠 Project Objective

This project aims to provide a clear and concise understanding of:

- What Node.js core modules are
- How to use them in real applications
- Practical examples using each module in a simple and straightforward manner

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/officialTechBro/nodejs_core.git
cd nodejs_core
```

### 2. Run a Module

Each module can be executed independently using Node.js:

```bash
node fsModule.js
```

To run the HTTP server:

```bash
node server.js
```

## 📚 Core Modules Demonstrated

| Module         | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| `fs`           | File system interactions (read/write files) |
| `os`           | System-level information (CPU, memory, uptime) |
| `path`         | File and directory path handling |
| `crypto`       | Hashing and encryption operations |
| `events`       | Event-driven architecture with custom emitters |
| `url`          | URL parsing and formatting |
| `process`      | Access and control of the current process |
| `http`         | Building a simple web server |

---

## 🌐 Server Details

The `server.js` script spins up a basic HTTP server and routes incoming requests to different handlers based on the URL and HTTP method. The `postController.js` handles logic for `POST` requests specifically.

Example:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/posts -d "Hello World"
```

---

## 🛠️ Requirements

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v14+ recommended
- No external dependencies are required

---

## ✅ Future Improvements

- Add Express.js examples alongside core HTTP module
- Add a frontend interface to interact with the server
- Unit tests for each module demonstration
- Add comments and documentation in code
